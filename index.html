      Manchester United Football Club is a professional football club based in
      Old Trafford, Greater Manchester, England, that competes in the Premier
      League, the top flight of English football. Since 1992, Manchester United
      have won the Premier League 13 times. In total, we have won a record 20
      English League titles, a record 12 FA Cups, 4 League Cups, 3 European
      Cups. The team played in the Football League for the very first time in
      1892 (they should not be confused with Manchester Football Club, founded
      in 1860 and participated in the FA Cup in the 1870s before shifting to
      Rugby). But, they were relegated after two years. Next, a new group of
      local businessmen then took over the roles and responsibilities of the
      club and named it as Manchester United in 1902. The newly named club won
      the title of English League in 1908 under the guidance of Ernest Mangnall.
      The first FA Cup trophy was obtained the following year. The team then
      shifted to the current stadium, Old Trafford in 1910.
